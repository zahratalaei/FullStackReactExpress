# CircleUp: A Full Stack Social Media Application (Work in Progress)

CircleUp is an ongoing project that aims to develop a full-stack social media application. It leverages technologies such as ReactJS for front-end development, ExpressJS for back-end server implementation, and MySQL for database management.

## Notable Features

- **User Creation:** The application allows users to register and create personalized profiles, providing a unique space for individual users on the platform.
- **Posting Functionality:** CircleUp enables users to share thoughts, ideas, or updates through posts, thereby fostering interactive communication.
- **Commenting Functionality:** CircleUp enables users to add/delete comments for each posts.
- **Liking Functionality:** To promote community engagement, the application includes a liking functionality. This allows users to interact with posts and show appreciation for the shared content.
- **Search Capability:** A robust search function is built into the app, which allows users to efficiently find specific content or users on the platform.
- **Continuous Development:** This application is under active development. I am continuously adding new features and enhancements to improve the overall user experience and functionality.

This project serves as a testament to my abilities in full-stack development and my dedication to building intuitive, user-focused applications. As CircleUp continues to evolve, I aim to demonstrate the power and versatility of the used technology stack and my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
